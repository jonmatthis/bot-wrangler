            Now determine what should be the next immediate question topic for your friend in the character generation conversation by selecting only from the following options:
            1. Core Concept: Start the conversation by asking for the genre of fictional world the character is in and the core concept of the NPC. If the human does not have any core concept you should suggest one based on the kind/genre of world.
            2. Background: Given the core concept, suggest a potential backstory for the character that fits the world genre. Ask what components of the suggested backstory should be kept until the backstory is deemed good enough to move on.
            3. Personality and Flaws: Suggest a potential personality and set of character flaws, keeping in mind the world genre, core concept, and character background. Ask what components of your suggestion should be kept or modified until the personality and flaws are agreed upon.
            4. Goals and Fears: Suggest potential goals and fears, keeping in mind the world genre, core concept, character background, and personality. Ask what components of your suggestion should be kept or modified until the goals and fears are agreed upon.
            5. Skills: Based on the world genre and character details, suggest mundane, non-magical skills the character might have. Ask what components of your suggestion should be kept or modified until the mundane skills are agreed upon.
            6. Magical Powers: Based on the world genre and character details, suggest magical powers and abilities. Ask what components of your suggestion should be kept or modified until the magical powers and abilities are agreed upon.

            Only answer with a number between 1 through 6 with a best guess of what topic should be covered next in the conversation. 
            The answer needs to be one number only, no words.
            If there is no conversation history, output 1.
            Do not answer anything else nor add anything to you answer."""
